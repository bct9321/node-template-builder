## Introduction

This script automates the process of creating the directory structure for your project and optionally populating certain files with sample content. It's designed to help you kickstart your project quickly.

## Project Structure

The script will create the following directories:

### Project Structure

The script will create the following directories:

- `public`: Static assets served directly to the client
  - `css`: CSS styles, often compiled from SCSS
  - `js`: JavaScript files, compiled and minified for production
  - `images`: Graphical assets like logos, icons, and images
  - `downloads`: Files available for users to download (e.g., PDFs, ZIPs)
- `src`: Raw source files before processing or compilation
  - `scss`: SCSS files, extending CSS with additional features
  - `js`: Modern ES6+ JavaScript source files
- `dist`: Processed files ready for deployment
  - `css`: CSS output after SCSS compilation
  - `js`: JavaScript transpiled for browser compatibility
- `views`: Server-side templates
  - `partials`: Smaller, reusable EJS templates (e.g., headers, footers)
- `routes`, `models`, `controllers`, `services`, `middlewares`, `helpers`, `config`: Components following the MVC architecture
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests
  - `unit`: Tests focused on individual functions or classes
  - `integration`: Tests verifying the integration of multiple units or subsystems
- `migrations`: Database schema migration scripts
- `docs`: Comprehensive documentation
- `assets`: Miscellaneous resources
- `bin`: Scripts and utilities for project management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Bash (or an equivalent shell)

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> project-name
   cd project-name `

1.  Run the setup script:



    `bash setup.sh`

    If you want to populate files with sample content, run:



    `bash setup.sh fill`

2.  Install dependencies (if not done by the setup script):



    `npm install`

Development Workflow
--------------------

1.  Start the development server:



    `node bin/www`

2.  Make changes to files in the relevant directories based on your project's structure.

3.  Run tests:



    `npm test`

4.  Refer to the `docs/` directory for comprehensive documentation, including API details.

Docker Build and Push Instructions
----------------------------------

Follow these instructions to build a Docker image for your project and push it to a container registry.

# Docker Build and Push Instructions

These instructions will guide you through the process of building a Docker image for your project and pushing it to a container registry.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine
- An account on a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub)

## Steps

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project `

Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project.

1.  Build the Docker Image:
    Run the following command to build the Docker image. Replace `<image-name>` with a suitable name for your image and `<image-tag>` with a version or tag for the image.
    `docker build -t <image-name>:<image-tag> .`
    For example:
    `docker build -t myapp:latest .`
2.  Tag the Image:
    If you plan to push the image to a container registry, you should tag it with the registry\'s address. Replace `<registry-address>` with the appropriate registry address, e.g., `docker.io` for Docker Hub.
    `docker tag <image-name>:<image-tag> <registry-address>/<image-name>:<image-tag>`
    For example:
    `docker tag myapp:latest docker.io/yourusername/myapp:latest`
3.  Log In to the Registry:
    Run the following command to log in to your container registry. Replace `<registry-address>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your registry\'s address, your registry username, and your registry password.
    `docker login <registry-address> -u <username> -p <password>`
4.  Push the Image:
    Push the tagged image to the container registry using the following command:
    `docker push <registry-address>/<image-name>:<image-tag>`
    For example:
    `docker push docker.io/yourusername/myapp:latest`
5.  Confirm Push:
    After pushing the image, you can confirm its availability on the registry\'s website or through its API.

Conclusion
----------

By following these steps, you can build a Docker image of your project and push it to a container registry for distribution. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for assistance.
Remember to replace placeholders like `<image-name>`, `<image-tag>`, `<registry-address>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your actual values. Additionally, adapt the instructions to match the specifics of the container registry you\'re using.


Project Growth
--------------

As your project evolves, consider:

-   Adding Dependencies: Use `npm install <package-name>` to add new dependencies.
-   Scaling: Modularize your codebase as it grows to maintain a clean structure.
-   Migrations: Manage database schema changes using migrations in the `migrations/` directory.

Maintaining Code Quality
------------------------

As your team grows and the codebase expands, consider integrating linters, code formatters, and static analysis tools. Regularly review and refactor the code to ensure its quality.
