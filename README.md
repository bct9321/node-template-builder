## Introduction

This script automates the process of creating the directory structure for your project and optionally populating certain files with sample content. It's designed to help you kickstart your project quickly.

## Project Structure

The script will create the following directories:

- `public`: Static assets served directly to the client
- `src`: Raw source files before processing or compilation
- `dist`: Processed files ready for deployment
- `views`: Server-side templates
- `routes`, `models`, `controllers`, `services`, `middlewares`, `helpers`, `config`: Components following the MVC architecture
- `tests`: Unit and integration tests
- `migrations`: Database schema migration scripts
- `docs`: Comprehensive documentation
- `assets`: Miscellaneous resources
- `bin`: Scripts and utilities for project management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Bash (or an equivalent shell)

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> project-name
   cd project-name `

1.  Run the setup script:



    `bash setup.sh`

    If you want to populate files with sample content, run:



    `bash setup.sh fill`

2.  Install dependencies (if not done by the setup script):



    `npm install`

Development Workflow
--------------------

1.  Start the development server:



    `node bin/www`

2.  Make changes to files in the relevant directories based on your project's structure.

3.  Run tests:



    `npm test`

4.  Refer to the `docs/` directory for comprehensive documentation, including API details.

Docker Build and Push Instructions
----------------------------------

Follow these instructions to build a Docker image for your project and push it to a container registry.

(Instructions for building and pushing Docker images are provided in the original script)

Project Growth
--------------

As your project evolves, consider:

-   Adding Dependencies: Use `npm install <package-name>` to add new dependencies.
-   Scaling: Modularize your codebase as it grows to maintain a clean structure.
-   Migrations: Manage database schema changes using migrations in the `migrations/` directory.

Maintaining Code Quality
------------------------

As your team grows and the codebase expands, consider integrating linters, code formatters, and static analysis tools. Regularly review and refactor the code to ensure its quality.
